MariaDB Server 

This package contains a number of .deb files that together comprise the MariaDB
Server distribution.

The packages included in this archive may vary depending on the OS you're using
and its release version, as different components may require libraries or
functionality available only in newer releases. 

The .deb files can be installed individually, but there are complex
interdependencies that are difficult to resolve using dpkg alone. For that
reason, this package is distributed as a ready-to-use Debian archive, so that
you can use apt to install the packages in it.

In order for the package manager to be able to install these packages, you will
need to place them in a location that the package manager has privileges to
access. You may find that /opt is a good location where you can unpack the
archive and the package manager will be able to read it.

To use the archive with apt, create a mariadb.list file in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ that points to the directory where you've extracted
the files. A helpful script called setup_repository is included in this archive
to do this for you.

You'll need to do this work as root, so that you can write files to these
locations.

cd /opt
tar -xf ~/mariadb-10.5.13-ubuntu-focal-amd64-debs.tar
mariadb-10.5.13-ubuntu-focal-amd64-debs/setup_repository

After the repository is set up, you should update apt and install the
mariadb-server package.

apt-get update && apt-get install mariadb-server

If your operating system already provides its own MariaDB packages, you may
need to manually specify the version of the package you've downloaded. Version
numbers can be complicated, so you may wish to use a command such as this to
see all available versions, from which you can choose one:

# apt-cache show mariadb-server | grep Version
Version: 10.1.17+maria-1~xenial
Version: 10.0.27+maria-1~xenial
Version: 10.0.25-0ubuntu0.16.04.1
Version: 10.0.24-7
# apt-get install mariadb-server=10.0.27+maria-1~xenial
